        Although Messi has played in 4 professional teams, he is widely known
        for his career in Barcelona, and the legacy he built at FC Barcelona.

      Another h3 tags is used here because the previous topic about the teams 
      Messi has played for, so another topic subheading is used.

      <h4>Amount of Goals Messi has scored</h4>

      <p>
        Messi has scored 896 goals scored in his career, which is well above
        average for most players. Many people would consider Messi to be the
        most efficient scorers in all of football history, considering that he
        scores a goal about every 105 to 106 minutes, and reaching a peak of one
        goal every 89 minutes, which is a goal in every single game. This my not
        seem like a lot, but the average attacking player scores a goal every
        300 - 400+ minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This really shows Messi's brilliance when it comes to scoring goals, and
        his efficiency when it comes to scoring goals. If you include his
        assists, the goal contribution per minute decreases even more to a goal
        contribution about every 72 minutes.
