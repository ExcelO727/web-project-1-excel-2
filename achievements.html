      Messi has won a total of 46 trophies in both team competitions, and
      individual awards like the Ballon D'or and the Golden Boot. Ballon D'ors
      are awarded to the best overall player during that season. The Golden Boot
      is awarded to the player with the most goals that season.
    </p>
    <p>
      Messi has won numerous trophies both individually and in a team. With
      Messi winning a total of 8 Ballon D'ors making him the player to win the
      most Ballon D'ors in their career. He has also won 6 Golden Boots, and
      while that is not the most that a player has won, it is still much more
      than most players will ever see in their career.The amount of trophies
      that Messi has won alone surpasses the amount of trophies that some teams
      have won in total.
