      The img tag imports images from different sources, and inputs them in your
      website. It needs a src attribute, width attribute, height attribute, and 
      and alt attribute. The src attribute is used to determine what link the 
      image is coming from. The height and width tags are used to determine the 
      measurements of the sides of the image in the web page. The alt attribute
      is for people with vision impairments, and it reads out whatever is in the 
      alt attribute when using a screen reader.
